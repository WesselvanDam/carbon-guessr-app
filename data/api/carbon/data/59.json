  "description": "Average carbon footprint for the production and transportation of Fairphone's Fairbuds XL headphones. This does not include the use phase and the 'end of life' phase (such as recycling and waste management). Note that Fairphone's headphones are some of the most sustainably manufactured headphones, and their carbon footprint is lower than those of other typical smartphones as a result. Also note that this assessment comes from a study performed by Fraunhofer IZM and commissioned by Fairphone.\n\nFew headphones have a thoroughly analysed carbon footprint, and methodologies differ, making comparisons between models difficult. For that reason, the value of a single, well-researched model has been included in this collection instead of some average.",
