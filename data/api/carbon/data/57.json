  "description": "Average carbon footprint for the production and transportation of Apple's iPad Air 13 inch tablet, 2025 edition with 128 GB of storage. This does not include the use phase and the 'end of life' phase (such as recycling and waste management). Note that the value used here is from a research done by Apple themselves.\n\nSince tablets come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and feature options, it is difficult to define a typical carbon footprint. Additionally, methodologies for determining the footprint differ between companies. For that reason, the value of a single model has been included in this collection instead of an average.",
