  "description": "Average carbon footprint for the production and transportation of Samsung's QLED Q60C Smart TV with a 75 inch display. This does not include the use phase and the 'end of life' phase (such as recycling and waste management). Note that the value used here is from a research done by Apple themselves.\n\nSince TV's come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and feature options, it is difficult to define a typical carbon footprint. Additionally, methodologies for determining the footprint differ between companies. For that reason, the value of a single model has been included in this collection instead of an average.",
