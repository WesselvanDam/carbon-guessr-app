  "description": "Average carbon footprint for the production and transportation of the Fairphone 5 smartphone. This does not include the use phase and the 'end of life' phase (such as recycling and waste management). Note that Fairphones are some of the most sustainably manufactured smartphones, and their carbon footprint is significantly lower than those of other typical smartphones as a result.\n\nFew phones have a thoroughly analysed carbon footprint, and methodologies differ, making comparisons between models difficult. For that reason, the value of a single, well-researched model has been included in this collection instead of some average.",
