  "description": "Consuming 1 kWh of electricity requires *generating more* than 1 kWh because of losses occuring during transmission and distribution (T&D losses, e.g. through the electricity grid). The amount of T&D losses varies regionally as well. The carbon footprint value used here comes from the generation intensity of 2024 and the T&D losses from 2023.",
