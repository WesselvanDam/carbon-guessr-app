      "description": "Ever wondered about the climate impact of your daily choices? This collection measures the [carbon footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint) of various items and activities, such as food production, electricity usage, and transportation. It uses kilograms of \\( CO_2 \\) equivalent (\\(kg CO_2eq\\)) as a standard unit, allowing us to compare the warming effect of different greenhouse gases, like methane, to that of carbon dioxide. By comparing these values, you'll learn which activities have a large impact on our planet's climate and which are less important.",
